# Cloud Templates
this repository contains custom public cloud templates that I have to customize for me or my customer's needs.

At the moment there are 2 tested GDM templates that I customized in order to support Isolated VPCs, where an Internet Proxy is available and can be used during deployments.

I'll add other templates if other customization will be needed :)
