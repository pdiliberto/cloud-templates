# Cloud Templates
this repository contains custom public cloud templates that I have to customize for me or my customer's needs.

At the moment there are 2 tested GDM templates that I had to customize in order to support Isolated VPCs, where an Internet Proxy is available and can be used during deployments.

I'll add templates as I have the change to customize them.
